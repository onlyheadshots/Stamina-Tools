# Stamina-Tools
Mostly every tool needed for stamina packing. Note: I DID NOT MAKE THIS, THESE TOOLS WERE MADE BY IHEB, PERCY, AND OTHERS, I AM POSTING THEM SO EVERYONE CAN HAVE THEM



How to install: Go to the python website, install python 3.8.9 (MAKE SURE TO ADD TO PATH), then, run the installation bat folder, and you should be able to use all of the tools.
